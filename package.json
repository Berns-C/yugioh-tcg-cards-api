  "description": "RESTful API for managing Yu-Gi-Oh cards. This project serves as a learning exercise to develop a robust backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete archetypes(a group of cards who share a name component) or individual cards, providing a platform to practice CRUD operations, and data persistence. Also to explore various endpoints to interact with card data, to enhance my skills in building scalable APIs, and enjoy working with my favorite card game.",
